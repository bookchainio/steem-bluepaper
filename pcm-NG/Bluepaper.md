## Introduction

Steem dey provide a scalable blockchain protocol[^1] for publicly accessible and immutable content, along with a fast and fee-less digital token (wey dem dey call STEEM)[^2] wey fit make people get de currency by using dia brain (wey dem fit call "proof-of-brain"). De two building blocks wey dey dis protocol, both blockchain and token, depend on each other for security, immutability and longevity, and and so integral for each others' existence. Steem don dey successfully operate for more dan one year now, and don pass both Bitcoin and Ethereum for number of transactions wey e don process.[^3]

Compared to other blockchains, Steem don stand out as de first publicly accessible database for immutably keep content in de form of plain text along with in-built incentivization mechanism. This don make Steem a public publishing platform from which any internet application fit pull and share data while e dey reward dose wey contribute content wey valuable pass.

Inside de field of crypto-currencies, de unique properties wey STEEM get make am both "smart" and "social" compared to others, like bitcoin and ether. Dis come from two new features o de token. De first na pool of tokens wey dem dedicate to incentivizing content creation and curation (wey dem dey call "rewards pool"). De second na voting system wey leverages de wisdom wey de crowd to fit assess de value of content and distribute token for am. Dis two properties wey unique if dem joined dem, dem fit referred to am as Proof-of-Brain, wey be entendre wey based on Proof-of-Work[^4], wey dem use to emphasize de human work wey dem need to distribute tokens to community participants. Proof-of-Brain positions STEEM as tool wey dem take dey build perpetually growing communities, wey encourage dem members take add value for the community through de built in rewards structure wey dey.

In addition to dis advancements for blockchain and token technology, Steem like a system dey provides another advanced features wey enhance de user experience, like Stolen Account Recovery[^5], escrow services, user promoted content, a reputation system, and accounts wey dem take dey save. Dem do all dis while dem dey provide users with three second confirmation times and zero fees ontop all de transactions. All dis ones allow am to support the mission of bringing smart and social currency to publishers and community builders across de internet.

## Proof of Brain: Smart and Social Tokens

Token systems wey dey reward users as dem dey contribute to a token-based community system need mechanisms wey dem go take establish and evaluate content's social value: we dey call am "Proof-of-Brain."

### De Rewards Pool ("Where De tokens from dey come?")

One of de most innovative (and wey dem misunderstood pass) area of the steem blockchain na de "Rewards Pool" from were token dey distribute to valuable content creators. In order make dem understand wetin de Rewards Pool be, person first need to understand say dem dey produced de tokens differently for DPoS blockchains pass if dem dey PoW blockchains. For traditional PoW blockchains, tokens dey produced regularly but dem dey randomly distribute am to de people wey dia machines dey perform dia work ("miners").

Different from PoW-only cryptocurrencies, dem dey generate tokens for Steem for fixed rate of one block for every three seconds. These tokens go distribute to different actors for de system based on de defined rules of de blockchain. These actors, like content creators, witnesses, and curators, compete in specialized ways for de tokens. Unlike de traditional Pow means of distribution, where miners dey compete over raw computing power, dem dey incentivized de actors for Steem network make dem compete in ways wey add value to de network.

Dem set de rate wey new tokens take dey generate at to 9.5% per year starting in December 2016, and reduce to de rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. De inflation go continue to dey reduce for dis rate until e reach 0.95% after some period of about 20.5 years.

Of de supply of new tokens wey de Steem blockchain dey create every year, 75% of those tokens compose de "rewards pool" wey dem come dey distribute to content creators and content curators. Dem dey distribute 15% to vested token holders, and dem dey distribute 10% to Witnesses, de block producers cooperating inside Steem's DPoS concensus protocol.

#### Rewards for Content Creators and Curators

De users wey produce content wey add value to de network by creating materials wey go drive new users to de platform, as well as keep de existing users occupy and entertained. Dis go help to dey distribute de currency to plenty set of users and increases de network effect. De users wey take time take evaluate and vote on content dey play important role to dey distribute de currency to de users wey dey add de value wey big pass. De blockchain rewards together wit dis activities relative to dia value ontop de collective wisdom of de crowd wey dem collect tru de stake-weighted voting system.

#### Voting wit Staked-Token to Determine Allocation of Rewards

Steem operates on de basis of one-STEEM, one-vote. Unda dis model, person wey contribute pass for de platform, as dem measure am by dia account balance, get plenty influence ontop how contributions dem scored. Dem go fit buy stake or earn am. Users no go gain anoda influence if dem get plenty accounts, since wan single account wit an amount of stake go get de same influence as two different accounts sharing de same amount of stake. De only way for users go fit increase dia influence in de platform na to increase dia stake.

As e come be, Steem go only allow members to vote wit STEEM wen e go committed to a 13 week vesting schedule dem call am Steem Power. Unda dis model, members get wan financial incentive to vote for wan wey increase the long term value of dia STEEM.

## Speed and Scale for de Steem Blockchain

Dem design de Steem blockchain make e be one wey of de fastest and most efficient blockchains wey dey exist, wey dey necessary for dem to support de amount wey traffic expect or wan social media platform wey big pass the size of Reddit. Steem don already pass Bitcoin for plenty transactions, and e fit scale to support 10,000 or more transaction for one second.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

Often dey bottlenecked wey Proof-of-Work (PoW)[^6], plenty blockchains nor fit scale pass three transaction for wan second, wey be fraction of de world's financial traffic. Steem need plenty more scale and speed pass de offered wey PoW, and less known algorithm wey dem call Delegated Proof of State (DPoS)[^7] dem leverage am to lay de foundation wey blockchain complete for billions of users.

Because of DPoS, de Steem blockchain don dey generate wan new block every 3 seconds wit small computational load. Dis mean sey de blockchain fit process plenty transactions and hold plenty information, including content.

By finding the rules for wen wan Hardfork happen, de witnesses elected inside de DPoS framework fit quickly and efficiently decide if or not dem go move forward wit wan proposed hardfork, allowing de Steem blockchain protocol to evolved more rapidly dan plenty odas. De Steem blockchain don already successfully forked 18 times[^8], and each time wey hardfork don happen, only wan single chain don continue after de fork.

### ChainBase

ChainBase[^9] na de database portion wey de blockchain stack and replaced Graphene[^10] for 2016. ChainBase get faster load and exist times, supports parallel access to de database and get plenty robust against crashes dan him predecessor. E also get less frequent database corruption, allows instant "snapshotting" for entire database state, and fit serve plenty RPC requests from de same memory.

### AppBase

AppBase na de first step for creating plenty-chain FABRIC. AppBase dey make plenty components of de Steem blockchain to become modular if dem create anoda non-consensus blockchains as dedicated plugins. These plugins fit dey updated many more rapidly becus dem no dey ask replaying de whole blockchain. Dis na him make steemd[^11] get plenty efficient and dey easy to mentain and scale.

For practical, AppBase go fit make different cores, or even different computers, to mentain different parts of de Steem blockchain. Dis wan dey important pass plenty efficient dem dey ask every core, and every computer wey dey de network mentain de whole blockchain. Modularizing de blockchain go make am to take full advantage of de modular nature of computers. Dis wan na one neccessary step for de long process to take create wan full parallel, full optimized blockchain.

## Steems's Platform Features

De Steem blockchain dey serve as dual purpose were wan digital token processing system, and as mainstreem social medial platform. De features wey blockchain offer need to support de two purpose, and give users wan world class experience wen dem use de two aspects of de platform.

### Primitives Designed for Content Applications

Steem dey offer users de unique power to publish and keep different types of content directly and permanently inside de immutable ledger of de blockchain like plain text. Once e store inside de blockchain, data go com dey available publically for developers to build from. Developers go fit interact wit de content directly inside blockchain using de available APIs. Different blockchain primitives developers go fit build from include Account Name, Posts, Comments, Votes and Account Balance.

### Native Name System

Wallet addresses wey blockchain technologies use, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, get historical consisted of long strings of random letters and numbers, as e come be, these wallet addresses fit make am get wahala to transact wit oda useres in a typical online-social-media context becus users no go fit to remember de long-string address from memory. The Steem blockchain dey use each person user name as dia wallet address, wey bolsters de use experience for people who try to send tokens becus dem no fit verify de addresses from dia own memory.

### Steem Blockchain Dollars (SBD)

Plenty users wey dem introduced to cryptocurrency struggle to understand how "magic internet token" awarded by de platform fit actually get real world value. In order to help bridge de gap between plenty traditional fiat money systems which mainstream users dem use to, and de cryptocurrency tokens wey dem be award through de platform, dem come create a new currency wey dem dey call Steem Blockchain Dollars (SBD).

Dem design SBD tokens make e near closely to one USD, so dat user wey receive dem go know say approximately how many dem worth in "real dollar" terms. SBD tokens dey also offer a relatively stable currency for users wey hold am if dem want preserve their account value wey relative to USD. Plenty technical details wey dem explain dey inside Steem technical whitepaper.[^12]

### Decentralized Exchange

De Steem blockchain dey offer decentralized token exchange, we resemble Bitshares exchange.[^13] De exchange dey allow users trade their STEEM and SBD token throuhg a public decentralized peer-to-peer market. Users go fit place buy and sell orders, and order matching dey perform automatic by de blockchain. Publicly accessible still dey for order book and order history wey users fit use to analyze de market. Users fit interact with de exchange one on one using de blockchain API, or dem fit use GUI like de one wey dey Steemit.com.[^14]

### Payments Through Escrow

De irreversible nature of blockchain transactions get important security feature, but for plenty cases were users fit no dey comfortable sending their tokens to another user without any way to take get am back if de other uers no want hold up to him end of de agreement. De Steem blockchain dey provide a way make users take send coins to each other with a third part designated as escrow service. De user acting like de escrow service go fit determine if de terms of de agreement don reach, and either allow de funds to release to the receiver or return to de sender.

### Hierarchical Private Key Structure

Steem dey employ first of its kind hierarchical private key system take facilitate low-security and high-security transactions. Low-security transactions fit be social, like posting or commenting. High-security transaction fit be transfer and key exchanges. Dis go allow users to implement different level of security for their keys, depending on de access wey de key allow.

Dis private keys na de Posting, Active and Owner. De posting key dey allow accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, resteem[^15], and follow/mute other accounts. De active key dey for plenty sensitive tasks like transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Steem Dollars, voting for witnesses, placing market orders, and resetting de posting key. De owner key dey for use only wen necessary. Na the most powerful key becus e fit change any key of account, including de owner key, and to show ownership during an Account Recovery. Ideally dem do am to keep offline, and only use am wen de account keys need to change or to recover de compromised account.

Steem don facilitates de use of Master Password wey encrypts all de three keys. Webservices fit use Master Password wey decrpts and signs wit de necessary private key. Master Passwords fit allow users to trust certain services to keep improper keys make dem no transfer among any servers, den increasing user experience wen mentaining a secure client-side-signing environment.

### Multi Sig Authorities

De Steem blockchain dey allow authority make dem split among plenty entities, so dat plenty users fit share de same authority, or plenty entities go need authority to do transaction for am to be valid. Dis fit happen de same way like Bitshares[^16] where each public/private key dem assigned am to weight, and one threshold na for de authority. For transaction to dey valid, enough entities must sign so dat all their weights go meet or pass de threshold.

### Multiple Reward Beneficiaries

For any post we dem give there fit be different number of people wey go get financial interest for de reward. Dis wan include de author, possible co-authors, referrers, hosting providers, blogs wey embedded blockchain comments, and tool developers. Any website or tool wey dem use take construct post or comment go get de ability to set how rewards from dat comment go divided among different parties. Dis dey allow different forms of joinbody, and other ways wey platforms go fit build ontop of de Steem blockchain to collect one portion of de rewards from their users.

### Smart Media Tokens (SMT)

Smart Media Tokens na native tokens wey dem fit build on de Steem blockchain. STEEM na de first SMT wey don ever exist, and de Smart Media Token protocol target to monetize content websites and applications across de web wey allow people to create tokens wey possess properties wey resemble STEEM, but customizable wey suit de vision of any online community through incentivized behaviour, wey dey essentially replicate STEEMs success to any website or application. You go fit find plenty technical details inside de Smart Media Tokens whitepaper[^17].

### Recover Account Dem Thief

If anoda person touch any user account, dem fit change their key if dem use their private owner key. For de event wey person fit touch de private owner key and change de password for de account, de user get 30 days to submit de previously functional private key through Steem's industry-first account recovery process dem thief, and get control on their account. Dis fit get offer wey person or company wey provides registration services to Steem. E no dey compulsory for de registrar to give dis service to him own user, but dey available to increase de value of one register's users experience.

### Security Through Time-Locks

If user's active or owner key dem touch am, the person wey touch am get full access to all de money for their account. Becus blockchain transactions dey irreversible, users no get way to get their money back after dem thief am.

De Steem blockchain dey allow users to keep their STEEM and SBD tokens for savings account, so dat de money no go fit withdrawn until after three days watin period. In addition, STEEM wey dem keep for 13 weeks vesting schedule fit only withdrawn for de rate of 1/13 per week, after de initial watin time of seven days. Dis time-locks prevent de thief make dem no fit access de full portion of de user's money immediately, so dat the right person go get time regain control over him account before all the money go fit withdraw.

### Bandwidth Rate Limiting for Fee-less Operations

Becus de witnesses dem pay am entierly through the generation of new tokens, no need to charge de users any fee for powering de blockchain. De only reason wey dem go charge any fee as deterrent na to prevent users from completing unreasonable amount of transactions, wey fit potentially impact de performance of de blockchain.

In order make dem place better limits on the system use, dem go give each user limited bandwidth. Anytime users perform blockchain operations like token transfer, posting content, and voting, e dey use portion of dia bandwidth. If user pass their bandwidth allowance, dem must wait to do another actions until their bandwidth recharges.

Bandwidth limits adjust cos of network use, so users get higher bandwidth allowance wen de network usage don low. De amount wey badwidth account allow go directly proportion to de amount wey Steem Power user get, so users go fit increase their bandwidth allowance by getting another Steem Power.

## Finally

De unique rewards and incentive program wey Steem blockchain dey offer and token dem design am to make Steem de ultimate on-ramp into cryptocurrency for dem mainstream users. De performance of de blockchain dem design am with widespread mass adoption of de currency and platform in mind. If dem join am with de lightning fast processing time and fee-less transactions, Dem position Steem to become one of de leading blockchain technologies wey people dey use for all the world.
