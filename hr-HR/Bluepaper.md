## Uvod

Steem nudi skalabilni blockchain protokol [^1] za javno dostupan i nepromjenjiv sadržaj, uz brzi i beznaknadni digitalni token (zvani STEEM) [^2] koji omogućava ljudima da zarade valutu koristeći vlastiti mozak (što može obično naziva "Dokaz-Mozga"). Dva bloka za kreiranje ovog protokola, blokchain i token, zavise jedan o drugom zbog sigurnosti, nepromjenjivosti i dugovječnosti te su zbog toga sastavni dio za uzajamno postojanje. Steem je uspješno djelovao preko godinu dana te je sada prešao Bitcoin i Ethereum u broju obrađenih transakcija. [^3]

U usporedbi s drugim blockchainima, Steem se izdvaja kao prva javno dostupna baza podataka za nepromjenjiv pohranjeni sadržaj u obliku običnog teksta, zajedno s ugrađenim incentizovanim mehanizmom. To čini Steem platformom za javno objavljivanje sa koje bilo koja internet aplikacija može skinuti i podijeliti podatke dok nagrađuje one koji doprinose najvrijednijim sadržajem.

U području kripto-valuta, jedinstvena svojstva STEEMa ga čine ujedno i "pametnim" i "društvenim" u odnosu na ostale, kao što su bitcoin i ether. Ovo proizlazi iz dvije nove token značajke. Prvi je 'token-bazen' namijenjen podsticaju stvaranja sadržaja i kuracije (pod nazivom "bazen za nagrade"). Drugi je sustav glasanja koji utječe na mudrost korisnika da procijene vrijednost sadržaja i distribuiraju tokene za isti. Ova dva jedinstvena svojstva u kombinaciji se nazivaju dokaz-mozga, koji radi na temelju dokaza-rada [^4], namijenjen za naglasak na ljudski rad neophodan da se tokeni distribuiraju korisnicima zajednice. Dokaz-mozga je smjestio STEEM kao sredstvo za izgradnju zajednice koja neprestano raste, što potiče svoje članove za dodavanje vrijednosti u zajednicu kroz već ugrađenu strukturu nagrađivanja.

Osim ovih napredaka u blockchain i token tehnologiji, Steem kao sustav pruža dodatne napredne značajke za poboljšanje korisničkog iskustva, kao naprimjer oporavak ukradenih računa[^5], escrow usluga, korisničkog promoviranog sadržaja, ugleda sustava, i štednog računa. Sve se ovo događa dok pružamo korisnicima trosekundno odobrenje te beskamatne prijenose. Sve ovo omogućuje podršku misiji dovođenja pametne i društvene valute izdavačima i zajednici kreatora na cijelom internetu.

## Dokaz mozga: Pametni i Društveni Tokeni

Token sustavi koji nagrađuju korisnike dok pridonose zajednici token sustavu zahtijevaju mehanizme za uspostavu i analiziranje vrijednosti kvalitete sadržaja: to zovemo ”dokaz-mozga.”

### Bazen za nagrade (”Odakle tokeni dolaze?”)

Jedan od najinovativnijih (i najviše pogrešno razmljen) aspekt Steem blockchaina je „Bazen za nagrade” iz kojeg su tokeni distribuirani vrijednim kreatorima sadržaja. Da bi se razumjelo ono što je Bazen za nagrade, prvo treba shvatiti da su tokeni proizvedeni drugačije u DPoS blokchainima nego što su u PoW blokchainima. U tradicionalnim PoW blokchainima, tokeni su redovito proizvedeni ali nasumično podijeljeni ljudima čije mašine obrađuju rad ("rudari/miners").

Za razliku od samo PoW kriptovaluta, tokeni u Steemu su proizvedeni u fiksnoj stopi od po jednog bloka svake tri sekunde. Ovi tokeni se dijele različitim korisnicima sustava bazirano na određenim blokchain pravilima. Ti čimbenici, poput kreatora sadržaja, svjedoka te kuratora, se natječu na određene načine za tokene. Za razliku od tradicionalnih PoW distribucije, gdje se 'rudari' natječu za 'raw' snagu računala, korisnici Steem mreže su nagrađeni da se natječu u načinima koji će pridonijeti vrijednosti mreže.

Stopa kojom se stvaraju novi tokeni postavljen je na 9,5% godišnje počevši od prosinca 2016., a smanjuje se brzinom od 0,01% svakih 250,000 blokova, odnosno oko 0,5% godišnje. Inflacija će nastaviti padati po ovoj stopi dok ne dosegne 0,95%, nakon razdoblja od otprilike 20,5 godina.

Od opskrbe novih tokena koje je Steem blokchain kreirao svake godine, 75% tih tokena čine "nagradni fond" koji se distribuira tvorcima sadržaja i kuratorima sadržaja. 15% se distribuira vlasnicima dodijeljenih tokena, a 10% se distribuira svjedocima, proizvođačima bloka koji surađuju u Steemovom DPoS konsenzusnom protokolu.

#### Nagrade za kreatore sadržaja i kuratori

Korisnici koji proizvode sadržaj dodaju vrijednost mreži stvaranjem materijala koji će privući nove korisnike na platformu, kao i zadržati postojeće korisnike angažiranim i zabavljanim. To pomaže distribuciji valute širem skupu korisnika i povećava učinak mreže. Korisnici koji trebaju vremena za procjenu i glasovanje o sadržaju igraju važnu ulogu u distribuciji valute korisnicima koji dodaju najviše vrijednosti. Blockchain će nagraditi obje aktivnosti u odnosu na njihovu vrijednost zasnovanu na kolektivnoj mudrosti mnoštva skupljenih putem glasačkog sustava kroz ulogu procjenjivanja vrijednosti glasa.

#### Glasovanje sa 'staked' tokenima za određivanje dodjele nagrada

Steem radi na temelju jedan STEEM, jedan glas. Prema ovom modelu, pojedinci koji su najviše doprinijeli platformi, prema stanju računa, imaju najveći utjecaj na to kako se doprinosi ocjenjeni. Ulog se može kupiti ili zaraditi. Users can not gain additional influence by owning multiple accounts, since one single account with an amount of stake will have the same influence as two different accounts sharing the same amount of stake. The only way for users to increase their influence in the platform is to increase their stake.

Furthermore, Steem only allows members to vote with STEEM when it is committed to a 13 week vesting schedule called Steem Power. Under this model, members have a financial incentive to vote in a way that maximises the long term value of their STEEM.

## Speed and Scale on the Steem Blockchain

The Steem blockchain is designed to be one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in existence, which is necessary to be able to support the amount of traffic expected on a social media platform larger than the size of Reddit. Steem has already surpassed Bitcoin in number of transactions, and is able to scale to support 10,000 or more transactions per second.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

Often bottlenecked by Proof-of-Work (PoW)[^6], many blockchains can’t scale beyond three transactions per second, which is a fraction of the world’s financial traffic. Steem needed far more scale and speed than that offered by PoW, and so a lesser known algorithm called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)[^7] was leveraged to lay the foundation for a blockchain suited for billions of users.

Because of DPoS, the Steem blockchain is able to generate a new block every 3 seconds with minimal computational load. This means that the blockchain can process more transactions and hold more information, including content.

By defining the rules for when a Hardfork occurs, the witnesses elected within the DPoS framework can quickly and efficiently decide on whether or not to move forward with a proposed hardfork, allowing the Steem blockchain protocol to evolve more rapidly than most others. The Steem blockchain has already successfully forked 18 times[^8], and each time a Hardfork has occurred, only a single chain has persisted after the fork.

### ChainBase

ChainBase[^9] is the database portion of the blockchain stack and replaced Graphene[^10] in 2016. ChainBase has faster load and exit times, supports parallel access to the database and is more robust against crashes than its predecessor. It also has less frequent database corruption, allows instant “snapshotting” of entire database state, and can serve more RPC requests from the same memory.

### AppBase

AppBase is the first step in creating a multi-chain FABRIC. AppBase enables many components of the Steem blockchain to become modular by creating additional non-consensus blockchains as dedicated plugins. These plugins can be updated much more rapidly because they do not require replaying the entire blockchain. This makes steemd[^11] far more efficient and easier to maintain and scale.

Practically speaking, AppBase enables different cores, or even different computers, to maintain different parts of the Steem blockchain. This is significantly more efficient than requiring every core, and every computer in the network maintain the entire blockchain. Modularizing the blockchain enables it to take full advantage of the modular nature of computers. This is one necessary step in the long process of creating a fully parallel, fully optimized blockchain.

## Steem’s Platform Features

The Steem blockchain serves a dual purpose of being a digital token processing system, as well as a mainstream social media platform. The features offered by the blockchain need to support both purposes, and provide users with a world class experience when using both aspects of the platform.

### Primitives Designed for Content Applications

Steem offers users the unique ability to publish and store different types of content directly and permanently into the immutable ledger of the blockchain as plain text. Once stored in the blockchain, data becomes available publically for developers to build from. Developers are able to interact with the content directly in the blockchain using the available APIs. Several of the blockchain primitives developers can build from include Account Names, Posts, Comments, Votes and Account Balance.

### Native Name System

Wallet addresses used by many blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have historically consisted of long strings of random letters and numbers, however, these wallet addresses can make it difficult to transact with other users in a typical online-social-media context because users are unable to recall the long-string addresses from memory. The Steem blockchain uses each participant's user name as their wallet address, which bolsters the user experience for participants who attempt to send tokens because they can verify the addresses from their own memory.

### Steem Blockchain Dollars (SBD)

Many users who are introduced to cryptocurrency struggle to comprehend how “magic internet tokens” awarded by the platform can actually have real world value. In order to help bridge the gap between more traditional fiat money systems which mainstream users are used to, and the cryptocurrency tokens which they are awarded through the platform, a new currency called Steem Blockchain Dollars (SBD) was created.

SBD tokens are designed to be pegged closely to one USD, so that users who receive them can know approximately how much they are worth in “real dollar” terms. SBD tokens also offer a relatively stable currency for users to hold if they are looking to preserve their account value relative to USD. A more detailed technical explanation can be found in the Steem technical whitepaper.[^12]

### Decentralized Exchange

The Steem blockchain offers a decentralized token exchange, similar to the Bitshares exchange.[^13] The exchange allows users to trade their STEEM and SBD tokens through a public decentralized peer-to-peer market. Users are able to place buy and sell orders, and order matching is performed automatically by the blockchain. There is also a publicly accessible order book and order history which users can use to analyze the market. Users can interact with the exchange directly using the blockchain API, or use a GUI such as the one on Steemit.com.[^14]

### Payments Through Escrow

The irreversible nature of blockchain transactions is an important security feature, although there are many cases where users may not be comfortable sending their tokens to another individual without a way to get them back if the other user does not hold up their end of the agreement. The Steem blockchain provides a way for users to send coins to each other with a third party designated as an escrow service. The user acting as the escrow service is able to determine if the terms of the agreement have been met, and either allow the funds to be released to the receiver or returned to the sender.

### Hierarchical Private Key Structure

Steem employs a first of its kind hierarchical private key system to facilitate low-security and high-security transactions. Low-security transactions tend to be social, such as posting or commenting. High-security transactions tend to be transfers and key changes. This allows users to implement different levels of security for their keys, depending on the access that the keys allow.

These private keys are the Posting, Active and Owner. The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, resteem[^15], and follow/mute other accounts. The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Steem Dollars, voting for witnesses, placing market orders, and resetting the posting key. The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key, and to prove ownership during an Account Recovery. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used when the account’s keys need to be changed or to recover a compromised account.

Steem also facilitates the use of a Master Password that encrypts all three keys. Webservices can use a Master Password that decrypts and signs with the necessary private key. Master Passwords may allow users to trust certain services to keep improper keys from being transferred across any servers, thus increasing user experience while maintaining a secure client-side signing environment.

### Multi Sig Authorities

The Steem blockchain allows an authority to be split across multiple entities, so that multiple users may share the same authority, or multiple entities are required to authorize a transaction in order for it to be valid. This is done in the same way as Bitshares[^16] where each public/private key pair is assigned a weight, and a threshold is defined for the authority. In order for a transaction to be valid, enough entities must sign so that the sum of their weights meets or exceeds the threshold.

### Multiple Reward Beneficiaries

For any given post there may be a number of different people who have a financial interest in the reward. This includes the author, possible co-authors, referrers, hosting providers, blogs that embedded blockchain comments, and tool developers. Whatever website or tool that is used to construct a post or comment will have the ability to set how rewards from that comment are divided among various parties. This allows for various forms of collaboration, as well as a way for platforms that are built on top of the Steem blockchain to collect a portion of the rewards from their users.

### Smart Media Tokens (SMT)

Smart Media Tokens are native tokens that can be built on the Steem blockchain. STEEM is the first SMT to ever exist, and the Smart Media Token protocol aims to monetize content websites and applications across the web by allowing people to create tokens that possess properties similar to STEEM, but customizable to suit the vision of any online community through incentivized behavior, essentially replicating STEEMs success to any website or application. More technical details can be found in the Smart Media Tokens whitepaper[^17].

### Stolen Account Recovery

If a user’s account is compromised, they may change their keys using their private owner key. In the event that the attacker is able to compromise the private owner key and change the password on the account, the user has 30 days to submit a previously functional private key through Steem’s industry-first stolen account recovery process, and regain control over their account. This may be offered by a person or company who provides registration services to Steem. It is not mandatory for the registrar to provide this service to its users, but it is available to increase the value of a registrar's users’ experience.

### Security Through Time-Locks

If a user’s active or owner key is compromised, the attacker would have full access to all of the funds in their account. Because blockchain transactions are irreversible, users have no way to get their funds back after they have been stolen.

The Steem blockchain allows users to store their STEEM and SBD tokens in a savings account, so that the funds may not be withdrawn until after a three day waiting period. In addition, STEEM that is held in the 13 week vesting schedule may only be withdrawn at a rate of 1/13 per week, after an initial waiting period of seven days. These time-locks prevent an attacker from being able to access the full portion of the user’s funds immediately, so that the rightful owner has time to regain control over their account before all of their funds can be withdrawn.

### Bandwidth Rate Limiting for Fee-less Operations

Because the witnesses are paid entirely through the generation of new tokens, there is no need to charge users a fee for powering the blockchain. The only reason to charge a fee would be as a deterrent to prevent users from completing an unreasonable amount of transactions, which could potentially impact the performance of the blockchain.

In order to place reasonable limits on the system use, each user is given a limited bandwidth. Whenever users perform blockchain operations such as token transfers, posting content, and voting, it uses up a portion of their bandwidth. If a user exceeds their bandwidth allowance, they must wait to perform additional actions until their bandwidth recharges.

Bandwidth limits adjust based on network use, so users have a higher bandwidth allowance when the network usage is low. The amount of bandwidth that an account is allowed is directly proportional to the amount of Steem Power a user has, so users can always increase their bandwidth allowance by getting additional Steem Power.

## Conclusion

The unique rewards and incentive program offered by the Steem blockchain and token are designed to make Steem the ultimate on-ramp into cryptocurrency for mainstream users. The performance of the blockchain is designed with widespread mass adoption of the currency and platform in mind. When combined with the lightning fast processing times and fee-less transactions, Steem is positioned to become one of the leading blockchain technologies used by people around the world.
